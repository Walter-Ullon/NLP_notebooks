      "Good morning.  Last night I noticed Karissa was browsing the Target app on her iPad, ostensibly doing some online shopping at one of her favorite retailers.  I told her that was nice of her considering that their stock dropped 25% yesterday, maybe she’ll get a Thank You note from their CEO.\n",
      " \n",
      "The latest driver of “down” volatility (we’ve had “up” volatility this week too), is retail store earnings which show slowing sales.  That caused yet another fit among traders as the S&P 500 dropped about 4% yesterday.  Futures for the S&P 500 fell another 1.6% overnight, suggesting the index will open close to bear market territory — market shorthand for a 20% fall from a recent high. The broad market gauge briefly fell into a bear market during the pandemic panic in March 2020 before launching on a two-year rally that peaked on Jan. 3 this year.  Of the handful of recurring crosscurrents hanging over the global economy (and dragging down financial markets) is fear of a recession, but others include inflation, rising rates, war in eastern Europe, and rising COVID cases/lockdowns in China.  It’s a veritable grab-bag of excuses for traders to increase their intensity of buying and selling. \n",
      " \n",
      "Let me just help cut through the noise as the players in this protracted sell-off become more numerous and harder to track without a Playbill.  We know the following already:  The pandemic caused the government to lower interest rates to unprecedented levels (basically zero) to stimulate economic activity, while at the same time infusing trillions of dollars into the system via direct payments to consumers (aka “helicopter money”).  As inflation started to rise – too many dollars chasing too few goods/services which were still constrained by supply chain bottlenecks – the Fed was late to the party and wrote off the early signs of inflation as temporary.  Throw in higher energy prices due to the war and further COVID-driven supply constraints, the Fed is now having to be more aggressive in raising interest rates.  What’s interesting is their actions are having the desired effect of slowing economic activity, which is actually a good thing.  Economic activity needs to slow, and prices MUST come down.  Whether this causes a full-blown recession where economic activity slows dramatically and unemployment rises OR if the Fed managed to orchestrate a so-called “soft landing,” remains unknown.\n",
      " \n",
      "Remember, the economy and financial markets (seen daily via stock/bond/commodity markets) are not the same thing.  The economy is like a cargo ship and the markets are like a speed boat that’s both under and overshooting their course.  This means the biggest question right now for investors (not traders), is whether the financial markets and associated asset prices are overshooting their course.  If we think of the “course” as fair value or what stocks are truly worth, it does appear we have a sale going on right now.  Target is a great example of that – it’s the epitome of a well-run, much-loved business that is not going anywhere.  Is it really worth 25% less on Wednesday as the stock price reflects??  From a fair value perspective, that’s a definite no.\n",
      " \n",
      "The sliver lining to a market selloff, like we’ve been seeing in 2022, is stocks are getting cheaper.  Not to mix metaphors, but investing is the only business I know that when things go on sale, people run out of the store.  Take a look at Morningstar’s fair value chart for the last 12 months.  Through most of 2021, stocks were trading at about a 5% premium to fair value, a bit overpriced.  Now stocks are trading at a 16% discount, the net difference being about 20%.  In a surprise to no one, this delta is close to what the stock market is down this year. \n",
      " \n",
      "It’s important to remember that this sort of data, which are generally called “valuation metrics,” CANNOT be used market timing tools to know when to trade in and out of markets.  Expensive can get more expensive (as it has), and cheap can get cheaper (as it could in the future).  As investors, not traders, this is fundamentally why we don’t try to time entries and exits – if you get it “right” it’s because of luck and not skill.  Overall, we invest in financial assets in service of a broader financial plan.  No one I have ever set up a financial plan for has to count on ethereal market gains to pay for living expenses or short-term financial goals. \n",
      " \n",
      "I like to invoke the wisdom of the late Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard and the father of the index fund, who always recommended a buy-and-hold strategy for investors.  He previously told CNBC that buying stocks and holding them was the best way to invest because “your emotions will defeat you totally” if you try to sell your holdings to avoid losses and get back in afterwards.  “Stay the course,” Bogle said in 2018. “Don’t let these changes in the market, even the big ones change your mind and never, never, never be in or out of the market.  Always be in at a certain level.”  “Markets don’t settle down, they settle up,” he says. “By the time the news looks a little bit better, the market has already recovered. And if you miss the recovery, there’s a very, very good chance you’re going to make it harder to hit your financial goals.”\n",
