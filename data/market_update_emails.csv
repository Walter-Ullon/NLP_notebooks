"Good morning.  Hope you’re having a great start to your weekend.  I wanted to reach out with a quick market update. 
 
I haven’t sent out any market updates in a few weeks because the reality is we’ve been bouncing around about a +/- 10% range since the beginning of January.  This is what traders call being “rangebound” and the top and bottom price levels act as a box where markets can often stay for quite some time – currently about four months. 
 
You can see this box visually in yellow on the below YTD chart of the S&P 500. 
 
I know the details on that chart may be a bit hard to read, but the point is to show the major ups and down depicted by the arrows . . . this shows the “forest” if you will, not the “trees.”  What you’re seeing visually is the reason why as investors, we don’t try to time markets, buying and selling indiscriminately.  When should you get out?  When should you get back in again?  When should you get back out again?  You get the idea.  There is no human alive (or computer program) that could have predicted these market movements at the beginning of the year.  Speaking of computers, this reminds me of a famous quote from the increasingly relevant 1983 movie War Games, where the computer Joshua says, ""The only winning move is not to play."" 
 
Nonetheless, this week we saw a seemingly significant shift in monetary policy as the Fed chairman insinuated that he’d be open to voting for a 0.50% increase in interest rates during the upcoming Fed meeting.  That’s a change since previously the Fed has telegraphed only 0.25% rate hikes.  As I’ve mentioned in the past, stocks (and bonds) can get choppy during periods of rising rates – especially rising rates that are due to inflation shocks.  None of this seems all that surprising though, inflation has proven far stickier than the Fed had orginally assumed and recent increases in energy prices have clearly exacerbated the issue.  The result of those comments caused markets to sell off towards the bottom of the recent range this past Thursday and Friday.  You can see that on the far right of the above chart.
 
The only solace to investors is that the portfolio pain from rising rates will eventually tame inflation which is causing everyone to have to spend more in every area of life – goods and services.  Will the Fed have to raise rates far enough and fast enough to cause a recession in the short term?  No one knows.  The so-called “soft landing” where the Fed threads a needle, raising rates just the right amount to not destroy what is currently very strong employment, seems elusive.  As the attached piece from the WSJ this week indicates, the Fed has never successfully fixed a problem like this.  That’s okay though, recessions are a very normal part of the economic cycle and clearly the Fed no longer asleep at the switch.  Strong employment and consumer spending, which makes up a massive part of economic activity, remain robust and will likely for some time to come. 
 
Finally, I’ll leave you with a helpful piece from a New York Post opinion writer which includes some helpful lessons learned from the pandemic on aging and what’s really important in life.  Attached. 
Well worth a read!!
 
Enjoy the wonderful weekend."
"Good morning.  Hope you’re having a great start to your weekend.  I wanted to reach out with a quick market update and share with you a couple of items that I thought were of interest. 
 
This has been an excellent week for stocks, the best since the end of 2020, which is about time since it’s been a rough few months.  The S&P 500 was up nearly 6%, which is common during period of overall increased volatility.  Once again, this another reason why we don’t indiscriminately bail on stocks when they’re falling since they can snap back at any time.  Sticking with stocks during a correction (or a bear market, when we eventually get one), is courageous.  You can be pretty sure you’re manifesting courage as an investor when you listen to what your gut tells you — and then do the opposite.
 
As we all know, the 500-pound (Russian) bear in the room is the senseless war that Russian leaders are waging against their Ukrainian neighbors.  My friend shared an excellent piece on the geopolitical implications of the conflict that I wanted to share with you.  This is an interview hosted by Merrill Lynch with a gentleman named Ian Bremmer who is the President of Eurasia Group.  This conversation really framed the current situation and helped me understand more clearly how we got to this point and what may happen to our global relationships going forward.  If you’re interested, you can view this interview by clicking here . . . https://www.ml.com/articles/market-volatility-and-the-russia-ukraine-conflict.html.  (This second part of this video contains additional market commentary, but my feeling is that most interesting portion is from 2:00 to 26:25).
 
As we think about how we live our lives in light of this aggression from Russia, let’s remember that Russian Americans (as well as many Russian’s who live in Russia), are anti-war.  NY Post columnist Carol Markowicz, who’s also a Russian immigrant, wrote a timely opinion piece that’s a good reminder for all of us.

We’ve been hearing the “R-Word” lately as forecasters have raised their outlooks for a recession and boosted their inflation projection as the Federal Reserve faces the quandary of fast-rising prices and greater uncertainty from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the latest CNBC Fed Survey.  The probability of a recession in the U.S. was raised to 33% in the next 12 months, up 10 percentage points from the Feb. 1 survey. The chance of a recession in Europe stands at 50%.  Respondents debated whether the recent surge in commodity prices would prompt the Fed to hike rates faster because it adds to inflation or raise rates less because they reduce growth. 
 
While a recession is seen as a greater possibility than in February, it’s not the base case for most respondents. The average GDP forecast for this year slipped by 0.8 percentage point but remains at a slightly above-trend 2.8%. The GDP forecast for 2023 dropped by about a half a point from the last survey to 2.4%.  Inflation forecasts had already been high for this year, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has aggravated the situation with nearly 90% saying they boosted their 2022 inflation outlook because of the war. They added an average 0.8 percentage point to their inflation forecast. Sixty percent of respondents said they shaved the GDP forecasts due to the conflict, with an average of a half a point.  However, while inflation forecasts rose and growth outlooks declined, the outlook for stocks is relatively bullish. Respondents lowered their outlook for equities, but only 53% now say stocks are overvalued relative to the outlook for earnings and growth. That’s down from 88% a year ago, and the least bearish respondents have been since the Covid pandemic began.
 
Finally, I’ll leave you with a helpful piece from the NYT on five ways to soothe a mind overstimulated by anxiety, stress and streams of information.

Enjoy the start of spring."
"Good morning.  Last night I noticed Karissa was browsing the Target app on her iPad, ostensibly doing some online shopping at one of her favorite retailers.  I told her that was nice of her considering that their stock dropped 25% yesterday, maybe she’ll get a Thank You note from their CEO.
 
The latest driver of “down” volatility (we’ve had “up” volatility this week too), is retail store earnings which show slowing sales.  That caused yet another fit among traders as the S&P 500 dropped about 4% yesterday.  Futures for the S&P 500 fell another 1.6% overnight, suggesting the index will open close to bear market territory — market shorthand for a 20% fall from a recent high. The broad market gauge briefly fell into a bear market during the pandemic panic in March 2020 before launching on a two-year rally that peaked on Jan. 3 this year.  Of the handful of recurring crosscurrents hanging over the global economy (and dragging down financial markets) is fear of a recession, but others include inflation, rising rates, war in eastern Europe, and rising COVID cases/lockdowns in China.  It’s a veritable grab-bag of excuses for traders to increase their intensity of buying and selling. 
 
Let me just help cut through the noise as the players in this protracted sell-off become more numerous and harder to track without a Playbill.  We know the following already:  The pandemic caused the government to lower interest rates to unprecedented levels (basically zero) to stimulate economic activity, while at the same time infusing trillions of dollars into the system via direct payments to consumers (aka “helicopter money”).  As inflation started to rise – too many dollars chasing too few goods/services which were still constrained by supply chain bottlenecks – the Fed was late to the party and wrote off the early signs of inflation as temporary.  Throw in higher energy prices due to the war and further COVID-driven supply constraints, the Fed is now having to be more aggressive in raising interest rates.  What’s interesting is their actions are having the desired effect of slowing economic activity, which is actually a good thing.  Economic activity needs to slow, and prices MUST come down.  Whether this causes a full-blown recession where economic activity slows dramatically and unemployment rises OR if the Fed managed to orchestrate a so-called “soft landing,” remains unknown.
 
Remember, the economy and financial markets (seen daily via stock/bond/commodity markets) are not the same thing.  The economy is like a cargo ship and the markets are like a speed boat that’s both under and overshooting their course.  This means the biggest question right now for investors (not traders), is whether the financial markets and associated asset prices are overshooting their course.  If we think of the “course” as fair value or what stocks are truly worth, it does appear we have a sale going on right now.  Target is a great example of that – it’s the epitome of a well-run, much-loved business that is not going anywhere.  Is it really worth 25% less on Wednesday as the stock price reflects??  From a fair value perspective, that’s a definite no.
 
The sliver lining to a market selloff, like we’ve been seeing in 2022, is stocks are getting cheaper.  Not to mix metaphors, but investing is the only business I know that when things go on sale, people run out of the store.  Take a look at Morningstar’s fair value chart for the last 12 months.  Through most of 2021, stocks were trading at about a 5% premium to fair value, a bit overpriced.  Now stocks are trading at a 16% discount, the net difference being about 20%.  In a surprise to no one, this delta is close to what the stock market is down this year. 
 
It’s important to remember that this sort of data, which are generally called “valuation metrics,” CANNOT be used market timing tools to know when to trade in and out of markets.  Expensive can get more expensive (as it has), and cheap can get cheaper (as it could in the future).  As investors, not traders, this is fundamentally why we don’t try to time entries and exits – if you get it “right” it’s because of luck and not skill.  Overall, we invest in financial assets in service of a broader financial plan.  No one I have ever set up a financial plan for has to count on ethereal market gains to pay for living expenses or short-term financial goals. 
 
I like to invoke the wisdom of the late Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard and the father of the index fund, who always recommended a buy-and-hold strategy for investors.  He previously told CNBC that buying stocks and holding them was the best way to invest because “your emotions will defeat you totally” if you try to sell your holdings to avoid losses and get back in afterwards.  “Stay the course,” Bogle said in 2018. “Don’t let these changes in the market, even the big ones change your mind and never, never, never be in or out of the market.  Always be in at a certain level.”  “Markets don’t settle down, they settle up,” he says. “By the time the news looks a little bit better, the market has already recovered. And if you miss the recovery, there’s a very, very good chance you’re going to make it harder to hit your financial goals.”
 
Have a wonderful day!!"
